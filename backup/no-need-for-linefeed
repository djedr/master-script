structure conscious editor
	no need for linefeed
	
	raw text mode
		but only a part
		could initially use codemirror for that
		
		click on line area to switch
	
	minimap

eventually rid of codemirror
	but borrow good ideas
	drawing only relevant part
	
click on prefix:
	and start typing
		add argument before
		autoposition, autoprefix
	and backspace/space
		modify prefix
			what about other prefixes?
			
	no need for tabs and shiz
