How to make visual programming work?
It has to have all the features of text environment and more.

It has to be way better than anything before.

Combine the good parts of both.
Impossible/almost impossible to make a syntax error

THE bug:
gap between variables
arr:
0: obj
1: undefined
2: obj

because of off-by-one error

possibly when {alt} is empty this happens

why reference error then?
maybe env["alt"] = arr[1] // which is undefined

environment available in language
	first class
	
bind returns local environment if bound successfully
undefined if not?

bind[local-env][bind[][]]
bind[_][] just returns the env?

bind-in[dict][var][val]

bind[list[a b c d e]][replicate[0 5]]

[x] context
[v] scope 
[x] site
[x] region

string -> text
environment -> scope


substitute should handle strings

configurable substitute:
match meta structure
{{}}
{$ ...}
{$ ... $}
${...}?
