Hackers and computer scientists often like to call the first chapter of a publication "Chapter 0", especially if it is of an introductory nature. One of the classic instances was in the First Edition of K&R. In recent years this trait has also been observed among many pure mathematicians, where many constructions are defined to be numbered from 0.

lst\1st -> lst\0 -> lst[0]

def[o]\1st

lst\ord\o

ord converts ordinal to number (subtracts one)

1st -> 0
2nd -> 1
3rd -> 2
4th -> 3
