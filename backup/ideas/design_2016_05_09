constructing trees:
	drag & drop, clicking, visual techniques
	voice recognition
	text
	
basic format:
	text
	
alternate view on the AST

selection:
	longest correct parse within
	
invoke parser with certain input

manual mode: allow free text editing; invoke parse manually

if [ or ] deleted: switch to manual mode until [] rebalanced

always know the context
have the text be clean
on change parse the diff and insert into context
make text clean

inconsistent naming scheme:
	emitEvent
	character_index
	
[v] context in the tree
[v] character to the left of cursor
character to the right of cursor
incoming character
